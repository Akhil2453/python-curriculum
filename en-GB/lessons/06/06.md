# 06 â€” Noughts and Crosses

Time for another game, and today is Noughts and Crosses, or Tic-Tac-Toe. Players take turns marking an X or an O until one player gets three in a row.

## Step 1: Drawing the grid

We want to draw four lines, in a # pattern, like this:
```
_|_|_
_|_|_
 | | 
```

We could use the turtle commands to draw it, but today we're going to learn about the Tk Canvas.

1. Open up IDLE, create a New File

2. Write the following code

    ```python
    from tkinter import *

    main = Tk()

    c = Canvas(main, width=600, height=600)
    c.pack()

    c.create_line(200, 0, 200, 600)
    c.create_line(400, 0, 400, 600)

    c.create_line(0, 200, 600, 200)
    c.create_line(0, 400, 600, 400)

    mainloop()
    ```

3. Save and Run your program, and it will draw a grid !

### The Canvas


We make a 600 by 600 pixel window with `c = Canvas(main, width=600, height=600)`, which looks like this to the computer:

```
    0       200      400      600   ...
   0+--------+--------+--------+-----> across
    |
    |
    |
    |
 200|        A        B
    |
    |
    |
    |
 400|        C        D
    |
    |
    |
    |
 600|
    |
 ...|
    V
  down
```

Here point `A` is at 200 across, 200 down. Point `B` is at 400 across, 200 down. Point `C` is at 200 across, 400 down. Point `D` is at 400 across, 400 down.

Each of the commands `c.create_line(across1,down1,across2,down2)` draws a line across the screen, and the four numbers act as positions. If we wanted to draw a line from A to D, we would do `c.create_line(200, 200, 400, 400)`.

```
     0       200      400      600   ...
   0 +--------A--------B--------+-----> across
     |
     |
     |
     |
 200 M                          O
     |
     |
     |
     |
 400 N                          P
     |
     |
     |
     |
 600 |        C        D
     |
 ... |
     V
   down
```

We want to draw lines from A to C, B to D, M to O, and N to P.  

```python
c.create_line(200, 0, 200, 600) # A to C
c.create_line(400, 0, 400, 600) # B to D

c.create_line(0, 200, 600, 200) # M to O
c.create_line(0, 400, 600, 400) # N to P

```

In code, across is often called `x`, and down is often called `y`. 

## Step 2: Drawing a O

1. In the same file, let's add a new function to draw when you click the mouse!

    ```python
    from tkinter import *

    main = Tk()

    c = Canvas(main, width=600, height=600)
    c.pack()

    c.create_line(200, 0, 200, 600)
    c.create_line(400, 0, 400, 600)

    c.create_line(0, 200, 600, 200)
    c.create_line(0, 400, 600, 400)

    def click(event):
        c.create_oval(200,200,400,400)

    c.bind("<Button-1>", click)

    mainloop()
    ```

2. Run your code, and click on the grid, what happens?

   You should see a circle in the centre of the grid.

3. Let's edit the code, so it will draw where you click

    For this we'll need to take the mouse position, and work out which grid square it is in

    ```python
    from tkinter import *

    main = Tk()

    c = Canvas(main, width=600, height=600)
    c.pack()

    c.create_line(200, 0, 200, 600)
    c.create_line(400, 0, 400, 600)

    c.create_line(0, 200, 600, 200)
    c.create_line(0, 400, 600, 400)

    def click(event):
        across = int(c.canvasx(event.x)/200)
        down = int(c.canvasy(event.y)/200)

        c.create_oval(across*200,down*200,(across+1)*200,(down+1)*200)

    c.bind("<Button-1>", click)

    mainloop()
    ```

    `int(c.canvasx(event.x)/200)` takes the mouse position `event.x`, turns it into the canvas position, `c.canvas(event.x)` and then divides it by 200, and rounds it down, so we get a number 0, 1 or 2 to tell us how far across the mouse is.

4. Run the code, click in the grid squares, each one should fill in with a circle!

    The code `c.create_oval(across*200,down*200,(across+1)*200,(down+1)*200)` turns 'Along 1, Down 2' into positions on the grid, like Along 200, Down 400. 

## Step 3: Drawing an X


1. In the same file, let's add some code to draw an X, then an O, then an X, ...

    ```python
    from tkinter import *

    main = Tk()

    c = Canvas(main, width=600, height=600)
    c.pack()

    c.create_line(200, 0, 200, 600)
    c.create_line(400, 0, 400, 600)

    c.create_line(0, 200, 600, 200)
    c.create_line(0, 400, 600, 400)

    shape = "O"

    def click(event):
        global shape
        across = int(c.canvasx(event.x)/200)
        down = int(c.canvasy(event.y)/200)

        if shape == "O":
            c.create_oval(across*200,down*200,(across+1)*200,(down+1)*200)
            shape = "X"
        else:
            c.create_line(across*200, down*200, (across+1)*200, (down+1)*200)
            c.create_line(across*200, (down+1)*200, (across+1)*200, down*200)
            shape = "O"

    c.bind("<Button-1>", click)

    mainloop()
    ```
2. Run your program, try click on a grid, it should draw a O, click elsewhere it should draw an X

3. What happens if you click on the same square twice? 

    This is because our code doesn't keep track of what has been drawn, or where players have moved. We will have to 

## Step 4: Keeping track

TODO: Add in board state, don't let people play a square twice

## Step 5: Finding a winner

TODO:: Drawing a line through the winning

## Step 6: Click to replay


```python
from tkinter import *

main = Tk()

c = Canvas(main, width=600, height=600)
c.pack()

c.create_line(0, 200, 600, 200)
c.create_line(0, 400, 600, 400)

c.create_line(200, 0, 200, 600)
c.create_line(400, 0, 400, 600)

cross = False

board = [
    [" ", " ", " "],
    [" ", " ", " "],
    [" ", " ", " "],
]
def click(event):
    x, y = int(c.canvasx(event.x)//200),int(c.canvasy(event.y)//200)
    global cross, board
    print(x,y)
    if not winner() and board[x][y] == " ":
        if cross:
            board[x][y] = "X"
            c.create_line(x*200, y*200, (x+1)*200, (y+1)*200)
            c.create_line(x*200, (y+1)*200, (x+1)*200, (y)*200)
        else:
            board[x][y] = "O"
            c.create_oval(x*200, y*200, (x+1)*200, (y+1)*200)
        cross = not cross


def winner():
    for i in range(3):
        row = board[i]
        if row == ['X','X','X']or row ==['O','O','O']:
            return True
    for i in range(3):
        col = [board[0][i], board[1][i], board[2][i]]
        if col == ['X','X','X'] or col ==['O','O','O']:
            return True
    diag = [board[0][0], board[1][1],board[2][2]]
    if diag == ['X','X','X'] or diag ==['O','O','O']:
        return True
    diag = [board[2][0], board[1][1],board[0][2]]
    if diag == ['X','X','X'] or diag ==['O','O','O']:
        return True
            
    print('nope')

c.bind("<Button-1>", click)

mainloop()

```
