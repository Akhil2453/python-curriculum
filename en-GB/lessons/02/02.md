# Lesson Two: Turtle Power

Let's open the python editor IDLE and get started. Remember to create a new file, saving it to the Desktop. Since we'll be playing with the turtle, the first line of your new file will be 

```python
from turtle import *
```

## Step 1: Pen Goes Up, Pen Goes Down, We can explain that.

The turtle is a little robot that can draw, but it can also move without
draw without drawing. Use `penup()` and `pendown()` to turn drawing on and off.

```python
from turtle import *

for num in range(8):
    forward(20)
    penup()
    forward(20)
    pendown()
```

The code makes a dotted line. We can turn it into a new command by wrapping
it inside a function. 

```python
from turtle import *

def dashed(line_length):
    dash_length = 8
    for num in range(line_length/dash_length):
        forward(dash_length/2)
        penup()
        forward(dash_length/2)
        pendown()

dashed(100)
```

## Task 2: Pick a Colour, any Colour
```python
from turtle import *
from random import choice

colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']

def polygon(length, sides):
    for num in range(sides):
        pencolor(choice(colors))
        forward(length)
        right(360/sides)

polygon(10,4)
polygon(20,5)
polygon(30,6)
```
This is a list. We can pick one from the list by using a special function, `choice`

## Task 3: Your Universal Robot


```

def robot(height, face):
    if face == "happy":
        ...
    else:
        ...
```
