# Lesson Two: Drawing a Robot with your Robot Turtle.

# Step 1: Back to Square One

Open IDLE, the editor and open a new file by going to File > New Window, and let's get started. Like before, the first line will always be `from turtle import *` to tell Python we want to draw!

```python
from turtle import *

for n in range(4):
    forward(100)
    right(90)

```
Save it as a new file, and Run it from the Menu by going to Run > Run Module.

Remember that `for n in range(4)` repeats the code, and that the code needs to be grouped using spaces, or indented to be part of the the for loop.

We've seen this before, it's a square, but this time we're going to fill it in. Let's change the code to look like this

```python
from turtle import *

fillcolor('red')
pencolor('red')
begin_fill()
for n in range(4):
    forward(100)
    right(90)
end_fill()
```

Like with `pencolor`, `fillcolor` sets the color the turtle uses to fill in the shapes you draw. This draws a red square with a red outline.

Like we did last time, let's use variables to make our program clearer, 

```python

col = 'red'
sides = 4
length = 100
angle = 360/sides

fillcolor(col)
pencolor(col)
begin_fill()
for n in range(sides):
    forward(length)
    right(angle)
end_fill()
```

This is a long program, but now we can change it to draw any shape we wanted to, but we'd need to copy it over and over again.  Like before, we can write some code to stop having repeating ourself. This time we will define a new command.

We will edit the code and add `def poly():`, indent the code (you can select it and press Tab), and call the new command.

```python
from turtle import *

def poly():
    col = 'red'
    sides = 4
    length = 100
    angle = 360/sides

    fillcolor(col)
    pencolor(col)
    begin_fill()
    for n in range(sides):
        forward(length)
        right(angle)
    end_fill()

poly()
right(180)
poly()
```

Run it, it should draw two red squares. We've saved a little bit of time by defining a new command in python, and now we can draw a square twice, without having to write the whole thing twice. These new commands are called functions in python, and they're a great way to avoid writing so much.

We're not finished yet, how about we change the function so it can draw any shape, in any color!


```python
from turtle import *

def poly(sides, length, color):
    angle = 360/sides

    fillcolor(color)
    pencolor(color)
    begin_fill()
    for n in range(sides):
        forward(length)
        right(angle)
    end_fill()

poly(4, 100, 'red')
right(180)
poly(3, 150, 'blue')
```

Let's take it slowly here because this is kinda cool. Instead of setting the variables in the function, we say that the function takes some values, with some names, and then we put the values in where we call them.

We've moved the settings outside of the function, and moved them into the code that uses it. Now with one function we can draw *any* shape, of *any colour*. I don't know about you but this blows my mind every time I think about it.


```python
from turtle import *
from random import choice

colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow','black','pink']
def poly(sides, length, color):
    angle = 360/sides

    fillcolor(color)
    pencolor(color)
    begin_fill()
    for n in range(sides):
        forward(length)
        right(angle)
    end_fill()

for n in range(10, 3, -1):
    poly(n, n*15, choice(colors))
    right(20)
```

Let's open the python editor IDLE and get started. Remember to create a new file, saving it to the Desktop. Since we'll be playing with the turtle, the first line of your new file will be
