# Lesson Two: Drawing a Robot with your Robot Turtle.

## Step 1: Back to Square One

Open IDLE, the editor and open a new file by going to File > New Window, and let's get started. Like before, the first line will always be `from turtle import *` to tell Python we want to draw!

```python
from turtle import *

for n in range(4):
    forward(100)
    right(90)

```
Save it as a new file, and Run it from the Menu by going to Run > Run Module.

Remember that `for n in range(4)` repeats the code, and that the code needs to be grouped using spaces, or indented to be part of the the for loop.


Like we did last time, let's use variables to make our program clearer, and easier to change:

```python

sides = 4
length = 100
angle = 360/sides

for n in range(sides):
    forward(length)
    right(angle)
```

This is a long program, but now we can change it to draw any shape we wanted to, but we'd need to copy it over and over again.  Like before, we can write some code to stop having repeating ourself. This time we will define a new command.

We will edit the code and add `def poly():`, indent the code (you can select it and press Tab), and call the new command.

```python
from turtle import *

def poly():
    sides = 4
    length = 100
    angle = 360/sides

    for n in range(sides):
        forward(length)
        right(angle)

pencolor('red')
poly()
right(180)
poly()
```

Run it, it should draw two red squares. We've saved a little bit of time by defining a new command in python, and now we can draw a square twice, without having to write the whole thing twice. These new commands are called functions in python, and they're a great way to avoid writing so much.

We're not finished yet, how about we change the function so it can draw any shape, in any color! Like with `forward` and `right`, we can pass values into the function, rather than just edit the code each time.

```python
from turtle import *

def poly(sides, length):
    angle = 360/sides

    for n in range(sides):
        forward(length)
        right(angle)
    end_fill()

pencolor('red')
poly(4, 100)
right(180)
pencolor('blue')
poly(3, 150)
```

Let's take it slowly here because this is kinda cool. Instead of setting the variables in the function, we say that the function takes some values, with some names, and then we put the values in where we call them.

We've moved the settings outside of the function, and moved them into the code that uses it. Now with one function we can draw *any* shape, of *any colour*. I don't know about you but this blows my mind every time I think about it: we can teach the computer new instructions, and use them.


## Step N: Turtle Dash

Although the turtle is a little robot that can draw, it can also move without drawing. Remember that we can Use `penup()` and `pendown()` to turn drawing on and off. Open a new Python file, and put the following code in:

```python
from turtle import *

length = 200
for num in range(8):
    forward(length/16)
    penup()
    forward(length/16)
    pendown()
```

It draws a dashed line across the screen. Run it and check!

We can put the shape and dashed line program together, by replacing the `forward` with the code we have for dashes. We repeat the outer layer to draw each side of the shape, and then repeat on the inside to draw all the dashes. Edit your code
to look like the following:

```python
from turtle import *
speed(0)
shape("turtle")

def dashpoly(sides, length):
    angle = 360/sides

    for n in range(sides):
        for num in range(8):
            forward(length/16)
            penup()
            forward(length/16)
            pendown()
        right(angle)

pencolor('red')
dashpoly(4, 100)
right(180)
pencolor('blue')
dashpoly(3, 150)
```

We have two for loops inside each other, an outer one and the inner one. The outer loop `for n in range(sides)` draws each side of the shape, and each time runs the inner for loop `for num in range(8)` which draws the dashes. 

The outer loop uses the variable `n` to keep track of how many times it has repeated, and the inner loop uses the variable `num` to keep track. You have to use different variable names loops, or python will get confused.

Let's use functions again to clean up the code.


```
from turtle import *
speed(0)
shape("turtle")

def dashforward(length):
    for num in range(8):
        forward(length/16)
        penup()
        forward(length/16)
        pendown()

def dashpoly(sides, length):
    angle = 360/sides

    for n in range(sides):
        dashforward(length)
        right(angle)

pencolor('red')
dashpoly(4, 100)
right(180)
pencolor('blue')
dashpoly(3, 150)

```

This should draw the same thing, but hopefully it makes things clearer. 





## FILLER/TODO



```python
from turtle import *
from random import choice

colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow','black','pink']

def poly(sides, length, color):
    angle = 360/sides

    fillcolor(color)
    pencolor(color)
    begin_fill()
    for n in range(sides):
        forward(length)
        right(angle)
    end_fill()

for n in range(10, 3, -1):
    poly(n, n*15, choice(colors))
    right(20)
```

# Task 4: Drawing a Robot

We're going to draw a little robot, but we're going to break it down into small steps. First we'll draw the head, the body, then the arms and legs. Instead of writing out all of the instructions, we're going to use some little functions to help


# Drawing a leg

# Drawing an arm


# Task 4: Robot Dance Party
Let's open the python editor IDLE and get started. Remember to create a new file, saving it to the Desktop. Since we'll be playing with the turtle, the first line of your new file will be 





The code makes a dotted line across the screen. Let's use variables to clear things up, so we can draw a dashed line of any length:

```python
from turtle import *

length = 80
dashes = 8
dashlen = length/(dashes*2)

for num in range(dashes):
	forward(dashlen)
	penup()
	forward(dashlen)
	pendown()
```
Instead of working by hand how long a dash needs to be, we can ask Python to work it out. We repeat drawing a line and a gap, for the number in `dashes`, so if we want to move 80 pixels forward, we want to move 10 pixels forward 8 times for each repetition. This means we want to move forward 5 with the pen down, then 5 with the pen up.

Try playing around with it a little, before you move on.
