#Introduction:
This project teaches students numbers in Python, and how to perform calculations on integer, decimal and string data types. Students will use text calculation to easily print large ASCII shapes.

#Resources
For this project, Python will need to be installed. It is recommended that version 3.2 of Python is installed.

Students can also make use of the materials which accompany these challenges. Files included in this project's Resources folder (found under the 'Download Project Materials' link):

+ Scarf.py

Make sure that each student has read and write access to their own copy of these resources.

#Learning Objectives
+ Data types;
+ Numbers and calculations;
+ Dealing with logical errors;
+ Calculations using text strings.

#Challenges
+ Pocket money - expressions using numbers;
+ Words and numbers - expressions using numbers and text strings.
+ Code a scarf - expressions using numbers and text strings.

#Potential Problems
+ Students will not yet have learnt about the backslash escape character `\`. This means that students will get an error message if they try and use a backslash immediately before the end speechmark in their print statement. This problem can be solved by putting a space between a backslash and any speech marks. Similarly, two backslashes without a space (`\\`) will print as one (`\`). Adding spaces between backslashes will solve this problem.
+ Students should not use the speech mark character anywhere within a print statement, as the editor will incorrectly assume that this marks the end of the printed text.
