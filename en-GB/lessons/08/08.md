# Introduction {.intro}

Today, another Tk Game! Guide the explorer through the cave, trying not to hit the ceiling, floor, or the obstacles. Blocks will come towards you, and you have to click to avoid them.

We will build the game up, step by step, and the first activity is to just draw a box on the screen. Then we'll make the box fall and rise when the mouse is clicked, then we'll add obstacles to avoid, and walls too. Finally we'll calculate a distance.

# Step 1: A box on the screen {.activity}

First we're going to wait for the user to click, and then draw a box on the screen.

## Activity Checklist { .check}

1. Before we do anything, open up IDLE, and create a new file, `cave.py`

2. Write the following code into the editor:

    ```python
    from tkinter import *
    import random 

    main = Tk()


    c = Canvas(main, width=600, height=600)
    c.pack()

    xpos = 60
    ypos = 300

    size = 10
     

    def draw():
        c.create_rectangle(xpos,ypos,xpos+size,ypos+size, fill="black")


    c.bind("<Button-1>", draw)

    mainloop()

    ```

3. Save the code, Run the Code.
    
    You should see a new window which is completely empty.

    Click the mouse to draw a black box on the screen.

    You can change the colours of the box too.



# Step 2: Push to go up, let go to fall. {.activity}

The next step is to make the square fall and rise, based on if you are pressing the mouse button. 

## Activity Checklist { .check}

1. Change the source code to add the variables `playing` and `gravity` underneath the `size` variable.

    ```python
    xpos = 60
    ypos = 300

    size = 10

    playing = False
    gravity = 5
    ```

2. Just underneath, add a setup function, which configures the game when you start playing it.

    ```python
    def setup():
       global ypos, playing
       ypos = 300
       playing = True
    ```

3. Add functions underneath `setup` which will run when the mouse button is clicked, and released. 

    ```python

    def click(event):
        global playing, gravity
        if playing:
            gravity = -5
        else:
            gravity = 5
            setup()
            draw()

    def release(event):
        global gravity
        gravity = 5
    ```

4. Update the draw function too.

    ```
    def draw():        
        global ypos, playing

        ypos = ypos + gravity

        if 0 < ypos < 600:
            playing = False

        c.delete(ALL)

        if playing:
            c.create_rectangle(xpos,ypos,xpos+size,ypos+size, fill="black")
            c.after(30, draw)
        else:
            c.create_rectangle(xpos,ypos,xpos+size,ypos+size, fill="red")
    ```

5. Change the event handlers to use `click` and `release`

    ```python
    c.bind("<Button-1>", click)
    c.bind("<ButtonRelease-1>", release)

    mainloop()
    ```

6. Save and Run your code.

    When you start, click to begin, and the box should start dropping. 
    
    When you click and hold the mouse, the box starts rising. 
    
    If the box touches the top or the bottom of the screen, the game ends.

We use `ypos` to track the position of the box on the screen. We use `gravity` to determine how fast the box falls and rises. Try changing `gravity` to see what happens to the box, but don't make it too big a number, the game becomes impossible!


# Step 3: Adding blocks {.activity}

Keeping the box from touching the top and bottom of the screen is quite easy, so we're going to add a challenge. Let's add blocks that slowly move from right to left, which you have to avoid by moving up and down.

We'll create a list of boxes to draw, at random positions on the screen. Then we'll slowly move them from left to right, adding new blocks once they've moved off screen. We then need to check to see if the boxes collide and the game is over.


## Activity Checklist { .check}

1. Add a list to store the blocks, next to the other variables.

    ```python`
    blocks = []
    ```

2. Change the setup function to create new blocks, at a random position on screen.

    ```python
    def setup():
        global playing, ypos, distance, blocks

        blocks = []
        for i in range(6):
            x = i * 100
            y = random.randint(000,600)
            height = random.randint(size,size*5)
            blocks.append([x, y, height])

        ypos = 300
        playing = True
    ```

    `blocks` is actually a list of lists. Each item in `blocks` is a list of three values, `[x,y, height]` which describes where on the screen the block is, and how tall the block is. 

3. Update `draw`, to update the blocks position, and then draw it.

    ```python 
    def draw():        
        global ypos, playing, distance
        global blocks

        ypos = ypos + gravity
        distance = distance + size
            
        newblocks = []

        for x,y,h in blocks:
            x = x - size
            if x > 0:
                newblocks.append([x,y,h])
            else:
                newblocks.append([600, random.randint(0,600), random.randint(size,size*5)])

            if (x <= xpos < x+size) and (y <= ypos < y+h):
                playing = False
        blocks = newblocks

        c.delete(ALL)

        for x,y,height in blocks:
            c.create_rectangle(x,y,x+size,y+height,fill="black")

        if playing:
            c.create_rectangle(xpos,ypos,xpos+size,ypos+size, fill="black")
            c.after(15, draw)
        else:
            c.create_rectangle(xpos,ypos,xpos+size,ypos+size, fill="red")
    ```


# Step 4: Adding walls. {.activity}

## Activity Checklist { .check}

1. Add a list for the walls.

    ```python
    walls = []
    ```

2. Modify setup to build some random walls.

    ```python
    def setup():
        global walls, blocks, ypos, distance
        walls = []

        x = 0
        y = 0
        for i in range(600//size):
            y = y + random.randint(-5,5)
            if y < 0:
                y = 0
            x = x + size
            walls.append([x, y])

        blocks = []
        for i in range(6):
            x = i * 100
            y = random.randint(000,600)
            height = random.randint(size,size*5)
            blocks.append([x, y, height])

        ypos = 300
        playing = True

3. Update Draw to draw the walls as well.

    ```
    def draw():        
        global ypos, playing
        global walls, blocks

        ypos = ypos + gravity

        newwalls = []
        for x,y in walls:
            x = x-size
            if x >0:
                newwalls.append([x,y])
            else:
                walls.append([600,y+random.randint(-5,5)])
                
            if (x <= xpos < x+size) and (ypos<=100-y or ypos+size>= 600-y):
                playing = False
                
        walls = newwalls
            
        newblocks = []
        for x,y,h in blocks:
            x = x - size
            if x > 0:
                newblocks.append([x,y,h])
            else:
                newblocks.append([600, random.randint(0,600), random.randint(size,size*5)])
            if (x <= xpos < x+size) and (y <= ypos < y+h):
                playing = False
        blocks = newblocks

        c.delete(ALL)

        for x,y in walls:
            c.create_rectangle(x,600-y,x+size,600,fill="black")
            c.create_rectangle(x,0,x+size,100-y, fill="black")


        for x,y,height in blocks:
            c.create_rectangle(x,y,x+size,y+height,fill="black")


        if playing:
            c.create_rectangle(xpos,ypos,xpos+size,ypos+size, fill="black")
            c.after(15, draw)
        else:
            c.create_rectangle(xpos,ypos,xpos+size,ypos+size, fill="red")
            c.create_text(xpos, 300, text=str(distance), fill="red")

    ```
