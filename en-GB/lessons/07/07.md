# Teach the computer to play

## Step 1: Start with what we have from last week

1. Open IDLE, and either open your file from last week, or if you can't find it, copy the following in.

    ```python
    from tkinter import *

    main = Tk()

    c = Canvas(main, width=600, height=600)
    c.pack()

    c.create_line(200, 0, 200, 600)
    c.create_line(400, 0, 400, 600)

    c.create_line(0, 200, 600, 200)
    c.create_line(0, 400, 600, 400)

    shape = "O"
    grid = [
        "0", "1", "2", 
        "3", "4", "5",
        "6", "7", "8", 
    ]
        

    def click(event):
        global shape, grid
        across = int(c.canvasx(event.x)/200)
        down = int(c.canvasy(event.y)/200)

        square = across + (down*3)

        if grid[square] == "X" or grid[square] == "O":
            return

        if winner():
            return

        if shape == "O":
            c.create_oval(
                across*200,down*200,
                (across+1)*200,(down+1)*200
            )
            grid[square] = "O"
            shape = "X"
        else:
            c.create_line(
                across*200, down*200,
                (across+1)*200, (down+1)*200
            )
            c.create_line(
                across*200, (down+1)*200,
                (across+1)*200, down*200
            )
            grid[square] = "X"
            shape = "O"

    def winner():
        for across in range(3):
            row = across*3
            line = grid[row] + grid[row+1] + grid[row+2]
            if line == "XXX" or line == "OOO":
                return True
            
        for down in range(3):
            line = grid[down] + grid[down+3] + grid[down+6]
            if line == "XXX" or line == "OOO":
                return True

        line = grid[0]+grid[4]+grid[8]

        if line == "XXX" or line == "OOO":
                return True

        line = grid[2]+grid[4]+grid[6]
            
        if line == "XXX" or line == "OOO":
                return True

            
    c.bind("<Button-1>", click)

    mainloop()
    ```

2. Save and run the program, make sure it works!

    You should be able to click on squares, to place circles and crosses until there are three in a row.


## Pick a move at random

Before we can teach the computer how to play, let's get it to just make a move.



## Pick a move that wins


## Pick the move that blocks

```python
from tkinter import *
import random 
main = Tk()

c = Canvas(main, width=600, height=600)
c.pack()

c.create_line(200, 0, 200, 600)
c.create_line(400, 0, 400, 600)

c.create_line(0, 200, 600, 200)
c.create_line(0, 400, 600, 400)

grid = [
    "0", "1", "2", 
    "3", "4", "5",
    "6", "7", "8", 
]
    

def click(event):
    global shape, grid
    across = int(c.canvasx(event.x)/200)
    down = int(c.canvasy(event.y)/200)

    square = across + (down*3)

    if grid[square] == "X" or grid[square] == "O":
        return

    if winner(grid):
        return

    c.create_oval(
        across*200,down*200,
        (across+1)*200,(down+1)*200
    )
    grid[square] = "O"


    if winner(grid):
        return

    move = -1
    moves = free_squares()
    if not moves:
        return

    # find winning move if exists
    for possible in moves:
        new_grid = list(grid)
        new_grid[possible] = "X"
        if winner(new_grid):
            move = possible
            break

    if move < 0:
        for possible in moves:
            new_grid = list(grid)
            new_grid[possible] = "O"
            if winner(new_grid):
                move = possible
                break
        
    if move <0:
        move = random.choice(moves)
        
    across, down = move%3, move//3
    
    grid[move] = "X"
    c.create_line(
        across*200, down*200,
        (across+1)*200, (down+1)*200
    )
    c.create_line(
        across*200, (down+1)*200,
        (across+1)*200, down*200
    )
    
def winner(grid):
    for across in range(3):
        row = across*3
        line = grid[row] + grid[row+1] + grid[row+2]
        if line == "XXX" or line == "OOO":
            return True
        
    for down in range(3):
        line = grid[down] + grid[down+3] + grid[down+6]
        if line == "XXX" or line == "OOO":
            return True

    line = grid[0]+grid[4]+grid[8]

    if line == "XXX" or line == "OOO":
            return True

    line = grid[2]+grid[4]+grid[6]
        
    if line == "XXX" or line == "OOO":
            return True

def free_squares():
    # fix me
    return [pos for pos, square in enumerate(grid) if square not in "XO"]
        
c.bind("<Button-1>", click)

mainloop()
```
