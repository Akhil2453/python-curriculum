__Introduction:__
TODO: intro to python

the Python programming language was named after the Monty Python’s Flying Circus TV show, not after python the snake.

##Step 0: Installing Python. 

If python is already installed, skip to step 1.

Unless your computer is a mac, chances are you will have to install python.

TODO: install instructions for windows/mac/linux.

##Step 1: Hello, World!

Open IDLE, the editor that comes with python. All our code will be written in this program. 

To make a new program, open IDLE and choose File -> New Window. An empty window will appear, with *Untitled* in the menu bar. Enter the following code into the new  window:

```python
print("Hello, World")
```

Now, choose File -> Save. When prompted for a filename, enter hello.py, and save the file to your desktop. Then choose Run -> Run Module.

Congrats on your first python program :D
(PS You can tell it to print anythng you like)

__PROTIP__: On Windows and Ubuntu, use ctrl-N to create a new shell window, use ctrl-S to save your file after you’ve finished edit- ing, and press F5 to run your program.
On Mac OS X, cmd-N to create a new shell window, cmd-S to save your file, and hold down the function (fn) key and press F5 to run your program.

##step 2: Turtles

Next, we're going to have some fun with turtles. 

Open a new shell window and write:

```python
from turtle import *

speed(0)
shape("turtle")

forward(90)
 
```
Save your program as turtle.py and choose run -> new module.
See how the turtle moved forward 90 pixles? Let's make the turtle move around the canvas! Try using backward(distance) as well as turning the turtle by using right(angle) and left(angle).

TODO: Explain the code a bit more?
* 'from turtle import *' means we are using a python module, some code that other people have made rather than making everything over again
* speed() sets the speed of the turtle, it takes a vlaue between 0 and 10. 10 is the fastest, 1 is the slowest. Speed = 0 means that no animation takes place.
* shape() we are using the "turtle" shape, but it can also take the values "arrow", "circle", "square", "triangle" or "classic".


##Step 3: Drawing a Square

Lets make a square by telling the turtle how to move.

```python
from turtle import *

speed(0)
shape("turtle")

forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(90)
```
Save your program and choose run -> new module. Do you see a square?

##Step 4: Repeating Yourself (a for loop)

That last program had a lot of repeated instructions! We could draw a square through a for loop instead to save some time, yay.

```python
for count in range(4):
    forward(100)
    right(90)
```

TODO: explain what's going on??

Save your program and choose run -> new module.

Challenge: what if you want to make MANY squares of varying sizes? 

##Step 5:Triangles, Squares and Hexagons, Oh My! (simple functions)
```python
def square():
    for count in range(4):
        forward(100)
        right(90)

square()
```
Save your program and choose run -> new module.

### making a better function
```python
def square(length):
    for count in range(4):
        forward(length)
        right(90)

square(100)
```
Save your program and choose run -> new module.

### Challenge: can you draw a triangle, a hexagon, a pentagon?

### try to write the following shape function that works out the angle.
```pyhton
def shape(sides, length):
    angle = 360/sides
    for count in range(sides):
        forward(length)
        right(angle)

shape(23, 5)
```

### then let's draw a shape
```python

def shape(sides, length, angle):
    for count in range(sides):
        forward(length)
        right(angle)


shape(5, 100, 360/5)
```
##Step 6:Drawing A Robot

* Can you draw a robot like this one [insert pic]

* Draw your own robot

*fin*
