#lesson 01

__Introduction:__
TODO: intro to python

the Python programming language was named after the Monty Python’s Flying Circus TV show, not after python the snake.

##Step 0: Installing Python. 

If python is already installed, skip to step 1.

Unless your computer is a mac, chances are you will have to install python.

TODO: install instructions for windows/mac/linux.

##Step 1: Hello World!

Open IDLE, the editor that comes with python. All our code will be written in this program. 

TODO: Shell vs saving a file

Luckily, we can save our programs for future use. To save a new program, open IDLE and choose File -> New Window. An empty window will appear, with *Untitled* in the menu bar. Enter the following code into the new  window:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

Now, choose File -> Save. When prompted for a filename, enter hello.py, and save the file to your desktop. Then choose Run -> Run Module.

Congrats on your first python program :D

__PROTIP__: On Windows and Ubuntu, use ctrl-N to create a new shell window, use ctrl-S to save your file after you’ve finished edit- ing, and press F5 to run your program.
On Mac OS X, cmd-N to create a new shell window, cmd-S to save your file, and hold down the function (fn) key and press F5 to run your program.

##step 2: Turtles

Next, we're going to have some fun with turtles. 

Open a new shell window and write:

```python
from turtle import *

speed(0)
shape("turtle")

    
```
Save your program as turtle.py and choose run -> new module.

Lets make the turtle move around the canvas!

```python
from turtle import *

speed(0)
shape("turtle")

forward(90)
 
```
See how the turtle moved forward 90 pixles? Try using backward(distance), right(distance) and left(distance) as well as

Now let's make it turn!


##Step 3: Making shapes

clear canvas



draw a rectangle
draw a triangle

challenge: draw a robot

penup/pendown

###challenge: draw a robot

change color

def shape

pro tip: counting from 0

Every turtle can have its own shape. The ones available “out of the box” are arrow, blank, circle, classic, square, triangle, turtle.


```python

```
	
## this is at the top of every turtle file

from turtle import *

speed(0)

shape("turtle")
"""
### then first step is things like drawing a square

```python
forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(90)
forward(100)
right(90)

clear()
```
### then drawing a square through a for loop
```python

for count in range(4):
    forward(100)
    right(90)
```
```python
### making a function

def square():
    for count in range(4):
        forward(100)
        right(90)


square()
```
### making a better function
```python

def square(length):
    for count in range(4):
        forward(length)
        right(90)


square(100)
```
### then let's draw a shape
```python

def shape(sides, length, angle):
    for count in range(sides):
        forward(length)
        right(angle)


shape(5, 100, 360/5)
```

### Challenge: can you draw a triangle, a hexagon, a pentagon?

# try and write the following shape function that works out the angle.
```pyhton
def shape(sides, length):
    angle = 360/sides
    for count in range(sides):
        forward(length)
        right(angle)

shape(23, 5)
```
