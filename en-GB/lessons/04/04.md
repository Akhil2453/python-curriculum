# Lesson Four:  Turtles all the way down

# Step 1: A mountain, made of mountains.

Pick up your turtles, open IDLE, it's time to draw again. Look at the following three shapes,
how would we draw them in python?

```
_________________________

            /\
           /  \
          /    \
_________/      \________

            /\
         __/  \__
         \      /
____/\___/      \___/\___

```

The first is easy. Like we always do, the first line of the file is always `from turtle import *` so Python knows we want to draw.

```python

from turtle import *

def first():
	forward(90)

first()
````

The second one looks easy too, let's add it to the file we're writing.

```python

def second():
	forward(30)
	left(60)
	forward(30)
	right(120)
	forward(30)
	left(60)
    forward(30)

second()
```

But how about the third? Although it's rather involved if we wrote out all the steps, it's actually drawing the second mountain, four times. 

```
from turtle import *

def third():
	second()
	left(60)
	second()
	right(120)
	second()
	left(60)
    second()

third()
```

This looks awfully like our earlier function, but instead of calling `forward`, we're calling `second`. If we wanted to, we could even write the fourth one, and call `third` instead. This seems like an awful lot of work still, surely we can get the computer to understand what we're doing.

This shape is a special shape, which you draw by drawing it over and over: The third is made up of the second, the second is made up of the first. What we really want to do is tell the computer to keep drawing it over and over again until it is done.

We do this by splitting up the problem into two: The base case, and the special case. The base case is easy: it's just forward(100). The special case is a little harder, it needs to say 'Do the special case, but one less, until you get to the base case'. It's easier to look at the code.

```
from turtle import * 

def mountain(depth):
    if depth == 1: 
           forward(10)
    else:
        newdepth = depth -1
        mountain(newdepth)
        left(60)
        mountain(newdepth)
        right(120)
        mountain(newdepth)
        left(60)
        mountain(newdepth)

mountain(3)
```

We can see that we've used code very similar to `first`, `second` and `third`. We use an `if` to work out if we should draw the simple case, or the special one.  In the special case, we ask to draw a mountain, like how `third` called `second`, but we ask it to drawa simpler one each time, at a new depth, one less than what we started with.

Let's just add one last thing to the mountain file, change it to look like the following:
```python

from turtle import * 

def mountain(depth, length):
    if depth == 1: 
           forward(length)
    else:
        newdepth = depth -1
        mountain(newdepth, length)
        left(60)
        mountain(newdepth, length)
        right(120)
        mountain(newdepth, length)
        left(60)
        mountain(newdepth, length)

def snowflake(depth, length):
    mountain(depth, length)
    right(120)
    mountain(depth, length)
    right(120)
    mountain(depth, length)
    right(120)

snowflake(4,5)
```

This picture is known as the Koch Snowflake. If you like, try playing with the angles and seeing what happens.

## Step Two: Boxes, More Boxes, Even More Boxes. 

Let's look at another shape

```


___________________________

        ___________        
        |         |        
        |         |        
        |         |        
        |         |        
________|         |________

             _
        ____| |____        
        |         |        
       _|         |_       
      |_           _|      
    _   |         |   _      
___| |__|         |__| |___


```

Like before with the mountain, we have a simple case: a straight line, and a complex case: draw a line with a square bump in it. We can see the third one is just like before, drawing the second one a few times.

Let's open a new file and try to draw it:

```python

from turtle import * 

def box(depth, length):
    if depth == 1: 
           forward(length)
    else:
        newdepth = depth -1

        #
        #  What should go here?
        #

def xcurve(depth, length):
    box(depth, length)
    left(90)
    box(depth, length)
    left(90)
    box(depth, length)
    left(90)
    box(depth, length)
    left(90)

xcurve(4,5)
```

We've left the special case out for you to fill in; it should be trying to draw the bumpy line,
but calling `box(newdepth, length)` to do it. Your code should look very much like the mountain and snowflake.

# (Maybe sierpinsky curve too ?)
