# 05 â€” Hangman

Let's build a game: Hangman! The computer will pick a word, and the player can guess it letter-by-letter, but if they make too many wrong guesses, they'll lose.

## Step 1: Pick a word

We start by picking a random word, so let's begin

1. Open IDLE, and open a new window. 

2. Write in the following code:

    ```python
    from random import choice

    word = choice(["code", "club"])

    print word
    ```

3. Save your program, and run it. What word does it print?

4. Run it again, does it print a different word?

Each time you run this program, it picks a random word from the list `["code", "club"]`, using the `choice` function. 

## Step 2: Guess a letter

Now we've picked a word, let's find out how to guess a letter.

1. With the same file, edit the code so it looks like this

    ```python
    from random import choice

    word = choice(["code", "club"])

    for letter in word:
        out = out + "_"

    print("Guess a letter in the word:", out)
    ```

2. Save and run the program. 

3. You should see "Guess a letter in the word: ____", in the output window (the other window, not the one you've written your program in.)

    We use a for loop to build up some text with an underscore `_` for each letter in the word. The word "code" put in, will write out `____` to the screen.


4. Let's guess a letter! Change the code to look like this

    ```python
    from random import choice

    word = choice(["code", "club"])

    for letter in word:
        out = out + "_"

    print("Guess a letter in the word, then press enter:", out)

    guess = input()

    if guess in word:
        print("Yay")
    else:
        print("Nope")
    ``` 

    We use a new function `input()` to find out what the player typed. We use `if` to find out if the letter was in the word.

We've got the essentials down, so let's continue onward. 

(Python 2 Note: Use `raw_input` if you're on an old version of python)

## Step 3: Track the guesses

Now we're going to use two features of python, lists and the `while` loop. 

1. In the same file, edit the code to look like this:

    ```python
    from random import choice

    word = choice(["code", "club"])

    guessed = []

    while True:

        out = ""
        for letter in word:
            if letter in guessed:
                out = out + letter
            else:
                out = out + "_"

        if out == word:
            print("You guessed", word)
            break
            

        print("Guess the word:", out)
        guess = input()

        if guess in guessed:
            print("Already guessed", guess)
        elif guess in word:
            print("Yay")
            guessed.append(guess)
        else:
            print("Nope")

        print()
    ```

2. Run the code, try guessing the letters. 

    What we've done is put a loop, like `forever` in scratch, that will keep asking for letters from the player, until they guess the word.

    We also use a list, `guessed`, which we add the letters to when they're right. This program will loop forever until all the letters are guessed.


## Step 4: Track the mistakes

Hangman should only give you a few chances to guess, rather than trying every letter in turn

1. Edit the existing file, and change it to look like the following:

    ```python
    from random import choice

    word = choice(["code", "club"])

    guessed = []
    wrong = []

    while True:

        out = ""
        for letter in word:
            if letter in guessed:
                out = out + letter
            else:
                out = out + "_"

        print("Guess the word:", out)

        if out == word:
            print("You guessed", word)
            break

        guess = input()

        if guess in guessed or guess in wrong:
            print("Already guessed", guess)
        elif guess in word:
            print("Yay")
            guessed.append(guess)
        else:
            print("Nope")
            wrong.append(guess)

        print()

    ```
    We're using a new list, `wrong`, to store all the guesses that weren't right

Only one last thing before the game is complete, which is to only have a few chances to guess.

## Step 5: Only a few chances

1. Edit the file, to introduce a new variable, `tries`:

    ```python
    from random import choice

    word = choice(["code", "club"])

    guessed = []
    wrong = []

    tries = 7

    while tries > 0:

        out = ""
        for letter in word:
            if letter in guessed:
                out = out + letter
            else:
                out = out + "_"

        print("Guess the word:", out)
        print(tries, "chances left")

        if out == word:
            break

        guess = input()

        if guess in guessed or guess in wrong:
            print("Already guessed", guess)
        elif guess in word:
            print("Yay")
            guessed.append(guess)
        else:
            print("Nope")
            tries = tries - 1 
            wrong.append(guess)

        print()

    if tries:
        print("You guessed", word)
    else:
        print("You didn't get", word)
    ```

2. Run the file, and see what happens when you guess wrong letters

## Step 6: Add some new words in!
