# Introduction { .intro}

In this project you will create a dictionary of colours which maps hard to remember colour codes into friendly names.

# Step 1: Using hex colour codes { .activity}

## Activity Checklist { .check}

Python turtle has predefined colours such as 'red' and 'white' but you can also use hex colour codes (you may have seen these in the HTML course.) 

+ Create a new Python trinket <a href="http://jumpto.cc/python-new" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/colourful-resources</a>. If you're reading this online, you can also use the embedded version of this trinket below.

</div>

+ Add the following set up code for using the turtle:

    ![screenshot](images/colourful-setup.png)
    
    Notice that you used a named colour: 'white'.
    
+ Turtle has a list of colour names that you can use, but sometimes you want to choose your own colours. Turtle also allows you to use hex colour codes. 

  Open <a href="http://jumpto.cc/colour-picker" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/colour-picker</a> and choose colour you like. Find it's hex code beginning with a '#', such as '#A7E30E'. 
  
+ Copy the hex code, including the hash, by highlighting it and then right-clicking and choosing Copy, or using Ctrl-C. 
  
+ Now change the the line of code that sets the screen colour to use your colour. For example:

   ![screenshot](images/colourful-background.png)
   
   You can use right-click and Paste or Ctrl-V to paste your hex code into trinket. 
  
+ Choose another hex colour code and use it to create coloured text:

+ Try different colours until you get two that you really like that look good together.

# Step 2: A Colour Dictionary{ .activity}

## Activity Checklist { .check}
 
Using hex colour codes is really flexible but they are hard to remember. 

As you probably already know, a dictionary allows you to look up a word, and see itâ€™s meaning. In Python, a dictionary is even more flexible that that - it allows you to map a 'key' to a 'value'.

Let's create a dictionary to map from human-friendly colour names (keys) to computer-friendly hex codes (values). 

+ A dictionary is contained in curly brackets. 

  Create an empty dictionary called `colours`:

   ![screenshot](images/colourful-write.png)
   
+ Here's an example colour dictionary:

   ![screenshot](images/colourful-colours.png)
   
   A colon ':' separates the key (colour name) from the value (hex code.) You need a comma ',' between each key:value pair in the dictionary. 
   
+ Choose cool names for your colours and add entries to the dictionary for them. 

+ Now you don't need to remember the hex codes, you can just look them up in the dictionary. 

  Adapt the following code to use your colour names:
  
  ![screenshot](images/colourful-entries.png)
  
  The key goes inside square brackets '[]' after the name of the dictionary. 
  
+ Now you can update your code to look up colours in the dictionary:

  ![screenshot](images/colourful-use.png)
  
+ Test your code to make sure your text still displays correctly.

## Challenge: More colours! {.challenge}

Can you add more colours to your dictionary and try them out? Use the colour picker website to find more colours. 

Here's some example code to remind you how to use the turtle:

## Challenge: Create a poster

Designers often create a 'palette' of colours that work well together for a particular theme such as desert or space. 

Can you create a new Python project that uses a dictionary for a themed colour palette. You could choose autumn, forest, sea, Christmas, ice cream, the colours of your favourite sports team or an idea of your own. 

Create a poster using your colour palette dictionary.
