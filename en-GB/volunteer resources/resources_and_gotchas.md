#Volunteer resources

This is a new course, and unfortunately may have bugs, issues and problems. If you have ideas, comments or would like to help, come and join us on github https://github.com/CodeClub/python-curriculum

You can also email tef, (tef@codeclub.org.uk) too. We've tested the coursework, but your feedback will be invaluable for making it better, easier and more fun.

## Installing python

Although a little daunting, the python download page at http://www.python.org/download/ has everything you need to get started.

We've suggesting Python 3 over Python 2, and you will need to know which operating system and hardware to use.


## Python 2 vs Python 3

The course currently suggests using Python 3, but none of the examples depend on Python 3 features. All the code should work under Python 2, although there are some minor caveats.

### The Print statement

In python 2, print is a keyword, and so is normally written `print "foo"`, but in Python 3, print is an ordinary function and usually written `print("foo")`. Due to syntactic quirks, the python 3 style works in python 2, but it may lead to some confusion if a trailing comma appears, i.e `print("foo",)` works differently in Python 2 and 3.

### Floating Point

In python 2, `1/2` is 0, as python assumes integer division. In python 3, `1/2` is 0.5. We've tried to avoid relying on one behaviour or the other, and for python 2 this can be remedied by using floating point, i.e `1.0/2` or `1/2.0`. 

## Python Problems

We don't touch on any advanced or intermediate features in this course so far, and the majority of problems we've encountered from testing are as follows:

1. Missing ':' at end of `if`, `def`, `for`

    Everyone does this. I do this. This is probably the first syntax error people will encounter

2. Using `-` instead of `_`. 

    `-` is an operator and can't appear in variable names

3 . Missing or wrong indentation. 

    Python is very pedantic about whitespace. Tabs count as 8 spaces, but thankfully
    IDLE will convert tabs into 4 spaces (the python coding standard, so mixing them
    shouldn't come up)

    We've tried to cover indentation as much as possible without boring the students to
    death

4. Other classic syntax errors

    Misspelled names, missing or excess punctuation. 

5. Forgetting to open a new window in IDLE

    We've repeated this instruction a couple of times, but students need two windows open in IDLE to begin
    and occasionally start writing in the output window

6. The turtle window crashes after the program finishes running

    This is ok, the student can just rerun the program and it quits and restarts.
