title: Where is the ISS? — Volunteer Notes
---

#Introduction:
This project introduces the use of web services to find the current location of the International Space Station and the details of the astronauts who are currently in space. Children will work with JSON and Python data structures. 

#Online Resources

This project makes use of a set of web services. Please make sure you can access them from the computers that you will be using for Code Club. 

+ [Open Nofify APIs -- http://api.open-notify.org/] (http://api.open-notify.org/)

This project uses Python 2. We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

+ ['Where is the ISS?' starting point -- jumpto.cc/iss-go](http://jumpto.cc/iss-go)

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ [‘Where is the ISS? Finished' -- trinket.io/python/9ccc368bd5](https://trinket.io/python/b95851338c)

#Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ iss/iss.py
+ iss/map.jpg
+ iss/iss.png
+ iss/iss2.png

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ iss-finished/iss.py
+ iss-finished/map.jpg
+ iss-finished/iss.png
+ iss-finished/iss2.png

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

#Learning Objectives
+ Using web services to get live data;
+ Consolidation: using Python data structures and turtle graphics. 

#Challenges
+ Show the Craft - Reading data from a returned data structure;
+ Find more passover times - Passing inputs to a web service;

#Frequently Asked Questions
+ Note that this project uses both text input and turtle graphics, you can adjust the amount of space given to each in trinket.
